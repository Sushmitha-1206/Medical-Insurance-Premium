This project analyzes and forecasts medical insurance charges based on customer demographics and lifestyle factors. The dataset includes key attributes such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, and geographic region. The project begins with a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends that influence insurance payouts. Visualizations such as bar charts, box plots, and correlation heatmaps reveal critical insights—for example, the consistently higher charges incurred by smokers, regardless of gender.

Following the EDA, we implemented and compared multiple machine learning models to predict insurance premium payouts. The models used include Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. Evaluation was conducted using regression performance metrics, including R² Score, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Among these, the XGBoost Regressor delivered the best performance, accurately capturing nonlinear relationships within the data and providing robust predictions. This modeling pipeline can be extended for real-world deployment to assist insurance firms in making pricing decisions based on customer risk profiles.

As part of the analysis, we also conducted hypothesis testing to validate the statistical significance of observed trends. A key hypothesis tested was whether smokers are charged significantly more than non-smokers. Using a two-sample t-test, we found a highly significant difference in the average charges between the two groups (p-value < 0.05). This allowed us to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that smoking status has a measurable impact on insurance charges. This statistical validation supports our visual insights and strengthens the case for incorporating behavioral risk factors in premium calculation models.

This project offers practical value to insurance companies like ACME by improving risk assessment and enabling smarter pricing strategies. It demonstrates how combining EDA, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling provides a comprehensive understanding of claim behaviors. The tools and insights developed here can be used to tailor policies, detect high-risk customers, and ultimately support data-informed decision-making in the healthcare insurance domain.
